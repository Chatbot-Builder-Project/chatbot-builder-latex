\chapter{Project Management}
This appendix details the project management approach and methodologies used in developing the FlowX platform.

\section{Development Methodology}
The project followed an Agile development methodology with two-week sprint cycles. Key aspects include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular sprint planning and retrospective meetings
    \item Daily standup meetings for progress tracking
    \item Continuous integration and deployment
    \item Iterative feature development and testing
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Timeline}
The development was organized into several phases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1}: Initial Design and Architecture (2 months)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item System architecture design
        \item Technology stack selection
        \item Infrastructure planning
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 2}: Core Implementation (3 months)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Basic workflow engine
        \item Frontend builder interface
        \item Essential node types
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 3}: Advanced Features (2 months)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LLM integration
        \item Smart routing capabilities
        \item Visual customization tools
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Phase 4}: Testing and Refinement (1 month)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item System testing
        \item Performance optimization
        \item Documentation
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Tools and Practices}
The following tools and practices were used to manage the project effectively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Version Control}: Git with GitHub for source code management
    \item \textbf{Project Management}: GitHub Projects for task tracking
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: Confluence for technical documentation
    \item \textbf{Communication}: Discord for team communication
    \item \textbf{CI/CD}: GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments
\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Management}
Key risks were identified and managed throughout the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technical Risks}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LLM integration complexity
        \item Performance scalability
        \item Cross-platform compatibility
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Mitigation Strategies}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Early prototyping of critical features
        \item Regular performance testing
        \item Cross-platform testing automation
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
