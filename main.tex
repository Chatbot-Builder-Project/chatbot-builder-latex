% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
FlowX is a visual chatbot development platform that bridges the gap between static flow-based and dynamic LLM-powered conversation systems. 
\par\medskip
The platform features a drag-and-drop interface where developers can combine traditional decision trees with AI-driven interactions using specialized node types, including a smart switch capability for dynamic routing based on user intent. With FlowX, developers can create customizable chatbots, advanced automation systems, and more.
\par\medskip
Built on a microservices architecture with ASP.NET Core, Python/LangChain, and React Native, FlowX enables the creation of hybrid chatbots that maintain both predictability and adaptability. FlowX demonstrates improved chatbot development efficiency in domains requiring both structured workflows and natural language understanding.

\section{Development Workflow}
The repositories follow a microservices architecture pattern, with each service independently versioned and deployed. The development workflow includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature branches for development
    \item Pull request reviews for code quality
    \item Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
    \item Automated deployment to staging and production
\end{itemize}
