\section{Frontend}

\subsection{Overview and Architecture}
The frontend of FlowX is built with \textbf{React Native}, providing a cross-platform mobile development solution. The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer}: React Native components and screens
    \item \textbf{State Management}: Redux store with middleware for side effects
    \item \textbf{Service Layer}: API client and WebSocket handlers
    \item \textbf{Utils}: Helper functions and shared utilities
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Workflow Builder}
The core of the application is the visual workflow builder, implemented with several specialized components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Canvas Management}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Infinite canvas with pan and zoom capabilities
        \item Grid-based snapping for precise node placement
        \item Multi-select and bulk operations
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Node System}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Drag-and-drop node creation and positioning
        \item Smart port connection system with type validation
        \item Real-time node state visualization
        \item Custom node templates for different interaction types
        \item Bezier curve connections with interactive editing
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Node Editor}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rich text editor for message templates
        \item Dynamic form generation for node configuration
        \item Each node with its own properties
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Chat Designer}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Live preview of chatbot behavior
        \item Mobile-first chat interface
        \item Allows for designing the visuals of the chatbot
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Management and Performance}
The application uses Redux for state management with several optimizations for performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Store and Updates}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Normalized state shape for efficient updates
        \item Separate slices for UI state and domain data
        \item Optimistic updates for better responsiveness
        \item Redux Thunk for async operations
        \item Persistence middleware for auto-saving
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimizations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Virtual scrolling for large workflows
        \item Lazy loading of node components
        \item Memoization of expensive computations
        \item Batched updates for multiple changes
        \item Debounced save operations
        \item Selective re-rendering using React.memo
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cross-Platform Design}
The application ensures consistent behavior across platforms through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Responsive Design}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Platform-specific UI adjustments
        \item Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
